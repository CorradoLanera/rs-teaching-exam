### In Brief

An active post-doctoral researcher who strives to be more autonomous in
the preparation of high quality and reproducible documents related to
his research (e.g., lectures, papers and reports).




### General Background

Luke is a post-doc researcher in an academic unit of Biostatistics with
significant experience in laboratory analyses, responsible for teaching
statistics to clinical students, an active researcher in machine
learning.




### Relevant knowledge

# Learner persona: *Luke Lab*

### Starting Point

- He started to use R after his Ph.D., from the beginning of his
  post-doc career three years ago.

- He already knows (and likes) the main Tidyverse tools. He has not
  taken any specific course about Tidyverse, and he learn it "by doing";
  he has also read some parts of R4DS and Adv-R.
  
- He started to study and apply reproducible instruments (eg, reprex,
  and Rmarkdown) and principles (eg, version-control, package development)
  for his research projects.

- He already uses `{ggplot2}` to draw his plots using its essential
  tools (ie, mainly without knowledge regarding scales, themes, and
  customization).
  
- He is very active in writing lectures, reports, papers, and project
  proposals; he would like to be more autonomous in drawing his 
  plots.

# Learner persona: *Luke Lab*

### Needs

- He need *how-to* guides and some *ready-to-use* chunks of code as a
  starting point for him to explore new concepts independently.
  
- He would like to improve his skills in drawing plots using
  `{ggplot2}`, particularly regarding customization.


### Special Considerations

- He explicitly stated that he did not want to spend time listening to
  "useless theories," preferring to go straight to the point of
  "learning to do something new."
